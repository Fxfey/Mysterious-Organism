# Mysterious-Organism
In this project from Codecademy I was given many task to do with a givem 15 number randomly generated string.
This includes:
+ Comparing two DNA strings for identical characters and giving a % based off the comparison.
+ Returning "true" or "fasle" based on of they have 9 or more if the C or G DNA strand (true meant it would survive).
+ It would then return 30 "Specimens" thats would survive.
